Fantasy Draftaid

shoutout to the OG jayzheng for the og draftaid (https://jayzheng.com/ff/), 
big thanks for making your code public so people like me can play and learn with it.

trying out a tweak to the draftaid to instead of focusing on tiers, focus on projected fantasy points for each player, 
compared to the fantasy points of the best player expected to be available during your next pick.

still very early, need to iron out a few issues (such as when a player with a later adp has higher projections), and then will
look at adding more features such as picking your sources for adp and fantasy point projections, and changing your scoring.

anyway, if you're interested in it or want to give some feedback or ask questions, feel free to reach out.

cheers!
